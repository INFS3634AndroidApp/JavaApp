+        Addition-        Subtraction*        Multiplication/        Division%        Remainder


Different Data Type Division Notes
5 / 2 yields an integer 2 
5.0 / 2 yields a double value 2.5
5 % 2 yields 1 (the remainder of the division) 

Literals
A literal is a value that appears directly in the program. For example, 34, 1,000,000, and 5.0 are literals in the following statements: 
int i = 34;long x = 1000000;double d = 5.0;
A compilation error would occur if the literal were too large for the variable to hold 
For example, byte b = 1000 would cause a compilation error, because 1000 cannot be stored in a variable of the byte type 

Augmented Assignment Operators
+= Addition Assignment
E.g. x+=1; translates to x=x+1;

-= Subtraction Assignment
E.g. x-=1; translates to x=x-1;

*= Multiply assignment
E.g. x*=1; translates to x=x*1;

/= Division assignment
E.g. x/=1; translates to x=x/1;

%= Remainder Assignment
E.g. x%=1; translates to x=x%1;


Increment and Decrement Operations
Can be placed before (as a prefix) or after (as a suffix) the desired variable
If you place an increment or decrement operator as a prefix, the operator is applied before the rest of the expression is evaluated.
If you place the operator as a suffix, the operator is applied after the expression is evaluated.

Numeric Type Conversion 
range increases from left to right of the following:
byte, short, int, long, float, double 

Implicit casting
double d = 3; (type widening) 

Explicit casting
int i = (int)3.0; (type narrowing)
int i = (int)3.9; (Fraction part is truncated) 


Automatic implicit casting or Assignment Conversion 
When you assign a value to a numeric variable whose type supports a larger range of values (widening a type)it is automatically done.
E.g., you can assign a long to a float variable 

Explicit type casting 
When casting a type with a large range to a type with a smaller range (Narrowing a type) the target type must be specified
Syntax: specify the target type in parentheses ( ), followed by the variableâ€™s name 
For example: (int)1.7
