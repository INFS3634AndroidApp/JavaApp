Topic 2:
 A program typically perform 3 steps:
 1. Input Is received 2. Input is processed 3. Output is produced 

Storing user input – working with variables 
Quite often a program needs to store data in the computer’s memory so it           can perform operations on that data 

Programs use variables to store data in memory 

Think of variable as a value stored in a box in the computer’s memory 

Variable is represented by a name 
We need to specify the data type of a variable to let the compiler know what kind of data is stored in a variable 

Java provides different data types which we can use to declare variables 

byte 
short 
int 
long 
float 
double 

E.g.

x = 1; 
radius = 1.0;a = 'A';
int x = 1;


Named Constants 
While the values of a variable can change, a named constant represents data that never changes 
final datatype CONSTANTNAME = VALUE;


Reading User Input from Console 


Java import statement
import java.util.Scanner;

Create a Scanner object
java.util.Scanner;

Get Input Values
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); 
int value = input.nextInt();double d = input.nextDouble();


Identifiers 
Names given to identify an element (e.g. class, method, variable) 

Descriptive identifiers make programs easy to read (avoid abbreviations) 

Some rules for Java: 
An identifier must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). It cannot start with a digit 

An identifier cannot be a reserved word
 
Java is case sensitive: area, Area and AREA are all different identifiers 

Types of errors

Syntax Errors-Detected by the compiler 
Runtime Errors-Causes the program to abort 
Logic Errors-Produces incorrect result
