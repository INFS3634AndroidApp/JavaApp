Topic 1: Intro to programming

How to use Java:
	- A program is created in Java with a .java file (a source code file)
	- A compiler is used to compile (translate) the source code into a .class file (Java bytecode).
	- The Java Virtual Machine then executes the .class file
	- This file is then presented in a binary format, which the machine/computer is able to understand. 
	
Introduction to Netbeans:
 - Netbeans will be the IDE used for 1609  
	- An IDE or Integrated Development Environments is a software packages that includes a text editor for writing programs, a compiler, and other tools to help assist with programming

Why Java:
	- It is widely used across all organisations
	- It is used for Android apps

Steps for designing a program:
	1. Understand the goal
	2. Determine the steps to reach the goal
	3. Make your program

Pseudocode:
	- Informal coding that has no syntax rules 
	- Used for drafting

Flowcharts:
	- Graphical representation of steps to be taken
	- Breaks down complex programs into manageable steps

Sample code:

public class Introduction {

Public static  void main (String[] args) {
System.out.println("Welcome to INFS1609");
}

}

The result? 
It will print out Welcome to INFS1609


Makeup of a Java program:
• Class name- the name of the class
• Main method - a requirement of a class, this will be the starting point of a program
• Statements - line of code that are used
• Statement terminator - A semicolon ; which denotes the end of a statement
• Reserved words - special words to the compiler and cannot be used or changed
• Comments - lines that are not involved in the code itself
• Blocks - {} groups components in a program
