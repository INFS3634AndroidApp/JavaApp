Topic 5:

Loops = repetition The while loop

While loop:
Repeat statement(s) for an unknown number of
times until a condition becomes false

while (loop-continuation-condition) { // loop-body;
Statement(s);
}

A do-while loop:
Replace a while loop if the loop body has to be executed before testing the continuation condition

do {
  // Loop body;
  Statement(s);
} while (loop-continuation-condition);


The for loop:
for (initial-action; loop-continuation- condition; action-after-each-iteration) {
// loop body;
     Statement(s);
  }
Initial-action is executed only once
Then the loop continuation condition is evaluated
If the condition is evaluated to true:
Codes inside the loop body is executed
Then the action-after-each-iteration is executed
The process goes on until the continuation-condition is
evaluated to false


When to use which loop:
A for loop may be used if the number of repetitions is known, as, for example, when you need to print a message 100 times

A while loop may be used if the number of repetitions is not known, as in the case of reading the numbers until the input is 0

A do-while loop can be used to replace a while loop if the loop body has to be executed before testing the continuation condition
